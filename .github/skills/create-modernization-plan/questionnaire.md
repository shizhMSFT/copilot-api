# Clarification Questionnaire

For each question below, first attempt to infer the answer from available context (assessment report, user prompt, project structure). Only present a question via `ask_user` when the answer **cannot** be confidently determined. When asking, list all options and indicate the recommended default. Record every answer — whether inferred or user-provided — for inclusion in the plan's "Open Questions & Questionnaire" section.

## Environment Setup

Should the plan include environment/infrastructure provisioning?

* (Default if no infra configuration found) No — no infrastructure provisioning; focus on code migration only
* (Default if infra configuration found) No — use infrastructure/configuration already defined in the repository (for example, existing IaC, deployment manifests, or pipeline config)
* Yes — provision new infrastructure
* Custom — use an existing externally managed environment specified by the user instead of provisioning or repo-defined configuration (ask for resource group, subscription, environment name, or config path)

## Integration Testing

Should the plan include integration testing to verify migrated services?

- (Default when infrastructure is provided/provisioned) Yes — Real mode: use provisioned infrastructure from `infra/` or user-provided environment
- (Default when no infrastructure is provided) Yes — Mock mode: use mocked dependencies
- Yes — TestContainer mode: use containerized emulators/dependencies for supported services and mock unsupported dependencies
- Yes — Mixed mode: user-specified per dependency (ask for dependency list and mode per dependency)
- No — skip integration testing entirely

## Security & CVE Remediation

Should the plan include a security scan and CVE remediation task? This task runs after all upgrade and transform tasks and before deployment to identify and fix known vulnerabilities.

* (Default) Yes — include security/CVE remediation
* No — skip security/CVE remediation
* Custom - user input the security/CVE requirements

## Deployment Target

Which Azure deployment target should the plan use?

- (Default) Azure Container Apps — includes containerization; no separate containerization task needed
- Azure Kubernetes Service — includes containerization; no separate containerization task needed
- Azure App Service
- Azure App Service Managed Instance
- Azure Function App
- Azure Static Web App
- No deployment — migration only, no cloud deployment
- Custom — user-specified target (ask for details)

## Containerization

Should the plan include containerization (Dockerfile generation)? Skip this question if the deployment target already includes containerization (Azure Container Apps or AKS).

- (Default) Yes — generate Dockerfile and container build configuration
- No — skip containerization
